# Truth-or-Dare-Game ðŸ˜ˆ
My first C++ game project, still under maintenance â›‘. To be ready soon.

This first version doesn't make use of OOP, as a route I choose to limit myself and encourage crativity in the language.

Although I did make use of:

- Pointers
- File Stream
- Output Manipulation

## Next updates will include:
- A GUI to communicate with the user  - Using the same logic of this program to enhance creativity
- APK version available for mobile ðŸ“±
